Map
------------------------------------
All keys must be the same Type
Use to represent a collection of related properties
All values must be the same time
Don't need to know all the keys at compile time
Keys are indexed - we can iterate over them
Reference type! (don't need to worry about pointers)

Struct
-------------------------------------
Values can be of different type
You need to know all the different fields at compile time
Keys don't support indexing
Use to represent a "thing" with a lot of different properties
Value type (pointers)
